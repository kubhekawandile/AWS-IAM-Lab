# AWS IAM Lab â€“ Hands-On Project

## Overview
This repository contains my hands-on work with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. The lab focused on managing IAM users, groups, roles, and policies, and testing permissions to ensure alignment with security best practices and least privilege principles.

## Objectives
- Explore pre-created IAM users and groups
- Inspect IAM policies applied to groups
- Add users to groups with specific capabilities enabled
- Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL
- Test the effects of IAM policies on service access

## Initiative
In addition to completing the lab, I took the initiative to:
- Identify potential risks such as missing MFA and overly permissive accounts
- Map IAM configurations to GRC controls using **ISO 27001:2022** and **NIST CSF**
- Link observed misconfigurations to technical controls that can mitigate risks

## Key Deliverables
- IAM users and groups configured in AWS
- Policy inspections and testing using the sign-in URL
- Risk identification and mapping to GRC frameworks

## Detailed Walkthrough
For a full step-by-step walkthrough, screenshots, lessons learned, and control mapping, see [Notes.md](./Notes.md).
