# AWS IAM Security Lab  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This lab explored **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** by working with users, groups, and policies in a real-world scenario.  
As part of my own initiative, I also **mapped relevant security controls** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53) and **identified potential risks** that align with the lab configuration and outcomes.
